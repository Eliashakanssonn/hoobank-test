A project that I created out of Javascript Mastery´s yt video and source code. The landing page is built with React JS and tailwind css. 

Amazing video from Javascript Mastery where you could code along and learn alot.

The website is completely responsive. 

By creating this project I have learned alot. I have more knowledge about React JS and Tailwind CSS which can make me a more productive and effective developer. 

The design of the website was based of a Figma design. This tought me how to make the design to a reality with code. It´s easier to have a template to go from when developing.
As for example by having a Figma design that acts as a template for the build. 

Fun and exciting build.

Please do not hesitate contacting me at social media platforms.

Best wishes Elias Håkansson!
